# Models

This folder contains the model backends (contains the sampler locations) and best fits for the stellar variation and the eclipse.

### Best Fits
This folder contains npy files with the best fit parameters for the different eclipse and stellar variation models.

### MCMC Backends
Due to the size constraints on GitHub, this folder is empy, but the MCMC backends for each run can be requested by e-mail.
